Azure Backup Report
===================

            

The script will connect to your azure subscription and get all Azure backup job statuses from all Azure Backup Vaults. It includes all VM backups as well as File backups from the MARS agent. This is only achievable trough the debug log information at this
 stage. The report by default is exported to a HTML report, but you can use the EmailReport switch to email it through an SMTP relay.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
